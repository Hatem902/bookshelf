# Bookshelf

I built this app to experiment with the new Next.js 15 and React 19. It's a library app that helps organize and filter your books using collections, book states (read, unread, reading), reviews, and more.

To run locally :

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookshelf.git
   cd bookshelf
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run dev
```

Since many packages haven't yet listed the new React 19 as a peer dependency, you should use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` instead of `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
